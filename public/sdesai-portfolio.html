    <h2>What is a Website Developer</h2>
    <p>A website developer is responsible for creating and maintaining websites. They are in charge of the visual design, as well as the technical aspects such as site speed and navigation. Web developers may specialize in front-end or back-end development, depending on the job requirements. They work with clients to understand their needs and create a website that meets those needs. Website developers also use web-facing technology to build software and add features to websites. With the right skills and knowledge, anyone can become a successful website developer.</p>
    <h2>What is a Website Developer Portfolio?</h2>
    <p>A Web Developer Portfolio is a collection of projects and work that showcases the skills and abilities of a web developer. It typically includes examples of websites, applications, and other digital products that have been created by the developer. A portfolio is an important tool for any web developer to demonstrate their capabilities to potential employers or clients. It can also be used to show off the latest trends in web development, as well as highlight any unique approaches or techniques that have been employed. By having a portfolio, web developers can easily showcase their talents and make themselves stand out from the competition.</p>
